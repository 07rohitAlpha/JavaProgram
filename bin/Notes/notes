=======Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming===================
 Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts.
 The primary purpose of encapsulation is to bundle the data (variables) and the code (methods) that manipulates the 
 data into a single unit called a class. 
 It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
 Here are the main purposes of encapsulation:

 1.Data Hiding: Encapsulation helps to hide the internal state of an object from the outside.This means that the internal 
 representation of an object is not exposed directly to the outside world, which helps to maintain the integrity of the data.
 2.Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows the class to control the access to its data. This is usually done through access 
 modifiers like private, protected, and public.
 3.Improved Maintainability: By hiding the implementation details, encapsulation allows developers to change the internal 
 implementation without affecting the external code.
 4.Enhanced Security: By controlling access to the data, encapsulation helps to secure the data from unauthorized 
 access and modification.

in page object model we use for private access modifier in framework all instance variables as private set  all 
these private value can not be accessible directly by the other testing classes we will inti


=======================================Inheritance in Java=====================================================
 Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the fields and
 methods of another class. The class that inherits is called the subclass (or derived class), and the class being inherited
 from is called the superclass (or base class). Inheritance promotes code reuse and maintainability by allowing the subclass
 to reuse the code from the superclass, eliminating redundancy and making it easier to update and maintain code.
 
       class Superclass {
    // Fields and methods of the superclass
}

class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // Fields and methods of the subclass
}
========================Abstraction=========================================
Abstraction means to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.In java abstraction is achieved by 
interfaces and abstract classes. we can achives 100% abstraction using interfaces.
In Selenium, Webdriver itself acts as interface. WebDriver driver = new Chromedriver();
We initialize the chrome Broswer using Selenium WebDriver . it means we are creating a reference variable (driver) of the interface(WebDriver)
and creating an Oject. here WebDriver is an Interface and ChromeDrive is a class.
We can apply Abstraction in a selenium framework by using the Page Object Model design pattern. We define all our locators and their methods in the page class. 

==========================

what are different HTTP method 
GET:Fetch the data, (1.Retrive information from the given server using a given URL. 
2. Requests using GET should only retrive data and should have no other effect on the data.)
POST:create the data, (A Post request is used to send data to server, for example. customer information, file upload ,etc. using HTML forms
PATCH:partial update, 
PUT:full update
DELETE:delete the data 
OPTIONS: client to server.
HEAD:same as GET, but body is not coming and Transfers the status line and header section
